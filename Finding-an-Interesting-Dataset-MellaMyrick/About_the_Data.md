# Why are you interested in this dataset?

Battery remaining useful life (RUL) represents the remaining life until the end of life in a car battery. It is used to determine the battery health. I am interested in this particular dataset because I enjoy working on cars and am curious to know what contributes to the EOL (end of life) of the engine.

This dataset came from [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ignaciovinuales/battery-remaining-useful-life-rul). "Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The Hawaii Natural Energy Institute examined 14 NMC-LCO 18650 batteries with a nominal capacity of 2.8 Ah, which were cycled over 1000 times at 25Â°C with a CC-CV charge rate of C/2 rate and discharge rate of 1.5C.

From that source dataset, I created features that showcase the voltage and current behaviour over each cycle. Those features can be used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the batteries."

# What are 10 (or more) questions that you hope to answer through your data analysis?

No. | Question

2 | What is the average discharge time?
3 | What is the average charge time?
4 | Which variable has a positive correlation to remaining useful life?
5 | Does the discharge rate of 1.5C decrease as cycles increase?
6 | At what cycle does the RUL decrease?
7 | Out of the 14 batteries, which one had the best RUL?
8 | What is the average max voltage discharge?
9 | What is the average minimun voltage discharge?
